**Save As SVG** is a powerful Autodesk Fusion 360Â® add-in that allows users to export sketches as SVG files. 

Key Features and Functionality
==============================

**Core Functionality**: 
  It takes any sketch created within Fusion 360 and converts it into a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file.
**Versatile Applications**: 
  The exported SVG files can be used for various purposes, including laser cutting, CNC milling, or other 
  applications that require vector-based graphics.
**Ease of Use**: 
  After creating and finishing a sketch, users simply right-click on the sketch in the browser tree and 
  select the "Save to SVG" option.
**Customization Options**: 
  Users can modify the line weight and colors for lines representing the different sketch profile types 
  within the exported SVG. Available colors include :yellow-bold:`Yellow`, :green-bold:`Green`, 
  :cyan-bold:`Cyan`, :blue-bold:`Blue`, :magenta-bold:`Magenta`, :white-bold:`White`, :grey-bold:`Gray` 
  and :black-bold:`Black`.
**Face Filling**: 
  The plugin offers a "Fill Faces" option, which, when enabled, fills the enclosing faces of a sketch using 
  the selected color settings for perimeter, cutouts, or inset.
**Scale and Compatibility**: 
  By default, the plugin creates SVG files at a standard 96 DPI (dots per inch), matching the scale used by 
  Fusion 360, modern applications and browsers. For compatibility with older applications like Adobe 
  Illustrator or Vectric VCarve Pro, a **Scale** option is provided with alternate DPI settings.
**Beyond Simple Sketches**: 
  The plugin handles complex sketches, which may not contain closed loop profiles, with the provided 
  **Entire Sketch** option. This option ensures that all line vectors of the sketch are included in the SVG 
  export, regardless of their geometric complexity.

In essence, the "Save As SVG" plugin bridges the gap between Fusion 360's design capabilities and the needs 
of various fabrication and design applications that utilize SVG files.

General Usage Instructions

line types, including text objects:

  a web browser.
